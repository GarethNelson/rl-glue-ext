Because of the large number of downloads associated with the RL-Glue-Ext project, we have provided some structure that can help you navigate to the codec that you're looking for.

The sidebar on the left lists all of the different extensions that are currently available.

*NOTE:* Remember that you need to install [RLGlueCore RL-Glue Core] before you can use any of the other codecs.

If you would like to look at the list of all downloads in the default Google file sorter, that option is available [http://code.google.com/p/rl-glue-ext/downloads/list here].
