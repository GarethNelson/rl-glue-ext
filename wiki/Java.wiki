 These are both platform-independent RL-Glue codecs written in Java.  Java 1.5 or higher is required to use them.  Both distributions include a pre-compiled JAR file that has all of the Java classes already built and packaged.  There is also an automated installer program to add the RL-Glue classes as a system extension so they can be used easily by your programs.  It should install on most Linux and Unix platforms, including Mac OS X and on Microsoft Windows.
